Due to the rapid growth of children, and the complexity of myoelectric technology, children are not given the same 
opportunities to use myoelectric prosthetics as adults. This repository focuses on the progress of the MAP team in 
creating an affordable, trans-radial, myoelectric prosthetic, for a nine-year-old girl. The Muscle Activated Prostheses 
team is working on designing a myoelectric prosthetic that will cost under $1000 and will create an opportunity for a 
child that isn't currently available. The basic mechanism by which this device operates is as follows: electrical signals 
emitted, via muscle contractions, will be detected and used to control the hand in various set patterns of grip. Comprised 
in this device will be an EMG sensor, electrodes, a development board, motors and tendons to emulate finger motion, feedback, 
and a battery. This report includes the specifics in what the team has currently accomplished, and the steps that will be 
taken to accomplish further progress.

The repo consists of an XCode project to run the C++ code and the src folders.
